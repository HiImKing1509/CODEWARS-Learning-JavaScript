## Codewars 
`Codewars` is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata.

On Codewars the community and challenge progression is gamified, with users earning ranks and honor for completing kata, contributing kata, and quality solutions

The platform is owned and operated by Qualified, a technology company that provides a platform for assessing and training software engineering skills.
